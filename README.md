# KNN and Naive Bayes Classifiers

#### Data Science Project, December 2021

#### By **Christine Kiki**

## Description
This project involves implementing the KNN classifier in the Titanic Survival Prediction and Naive Bayes to classify emails as spam and non-spam. Once the experiment is conducted, the resulting metrics are to be calculated.

Experimental Procedure:

1. Downloading the dataset.
2. Randomly partitioning the dataset into two parts; 80-20 sets.
5. Computing the accuracy (percentage of correct classification).
6. Reporting the confusion matrix of the classifier.
7. Repeating step 2 to step 4 twice, each time splitting the dataset differently i.e. 70-30, 60-40, then noting the outcomes of the modeling.
8. Suggesting and applying at least one of the optimization techniques learned.
9. Providing further recommendations to improve the classifier
